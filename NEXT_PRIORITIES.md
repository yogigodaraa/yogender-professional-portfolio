## 💡 My Recommendation

**Start with Experience Data today** because:
- Quick to do (1-2 hours)
- Improves code organization
- Sets pattern for other data
- Gets you in momentum

Then **tackle Project Images** because:
- Huge visual impact for recruiters
- Only need 4 screenshots/mockups
- Can be generic/placeholder initially
- Makes projects page actually impressive
